## Clarifications

- If a hostage taker breaks any of the regulations listed in this document, any combative regardless of rank or subdivision may terminate the hostage takers who are violating the regulations.

- If a Class-D makes a request that you cannot abide by (as in, anything that isn't listed in the document), and if they keep requesting it even after you specify that it's not allowed, you're fully allowed to engage and terminate them.

- Class-D cannot ask you to do anything immature, such as dancing, and you may terminate them if that's their request.

- Combatives do not NEED to meet any Class-D demands, however it can be done if necessary.

- Any request that is not listed in the following table will count as an invalid request.
