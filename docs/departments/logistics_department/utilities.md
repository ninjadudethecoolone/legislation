 This section serves as a mini-assistance handbook for Entrant Logistics Officers in order to give them a decent start within the department.

## What to do first as an Entrant
 As an Entrant Logistics Officer you are tasked with learning the basic duties of the Logistics Department and its regulations, you will be given access to at least two vehicles at the beginning. It is your responsibility to read the rest of the guidelines and its sections.

You should prioritise going to a training held by the Logistics Department's Medium Command, it will be scheduled within the event according notice channels. There is no specific set time for when these are held, albeit they will be held frequently in order for you to progress with your ranks. Focus on getting used to the Logistics Department and its members in addition to this as a first thing to do.
