While in the Manufacturing Department’s Quality Assurance Team, you will learn to be accustomed to the multitude of duties and activities that those within the department participate in. Due to said duties resulting in the level of quality in game that players experience, these procedures must be followed to the word, as even the smallest oversight can lead to the most massive of alterations. 

The duties will be described below, beginning with how updates are received, to testing in the Staging Area, to reporting and providing detail on a multitude of bugs.

## Testing Updates

As a member of the Quality Assurance Team, you are responsible for experimenting and testing new updates and additions prior to their release. The following are procedures for when an example update is added by MaD.

1. Step 1 is to always thoroughly read the update, so you know what exactly you will be experimenting with. If it is specific to one department, which does not pertain to you, then you are exempt from Quality Assurance Testing for that update.

2. If it is a general update, or one that concerns any department or subdivision you participate in, your next step will be to open up the Pathos Staging Area, and enter the game.

3. Upon entering the staging area, you are to start with generally understanding the effects of the new update. As an example, if it is a new SCP, you are permitted to interact with it. Alternatively, if a new area was introduced, you would enter and explore the area. 

4. Upon achieving a complete understanding of the addition or alteration, you are to test the full potential of the addition, in an attempt to uncover any bugs or issues that could be revealed after it is published to the main game. As an example, if it is with a damaging SCP, you could combine it with other sorts of damage, to determine if the SCP’s effects are altered in a non-intentional way. Or, if it is a new vehicle system, you could move around in the vehicle, and stress test it with multiple individuals or other teams. If the new addition does not include scripting, then make sure the builds around do not cause any major hindrance to the game, or do not leave any open areas. 

5. Upon the completion of this, you are to exit the staging area, and provide any requisite feedback in the standard discussion channel.

## Reporting & Testing Bugs

As a Quality Assurance Tester, oftentimes bugs that were overlooked within the Pathos Staging Area are able to sneak their way ingame and wreak havoc upon the complex workings the game provides. 

Due to prevention and protection already failing within this scenario, the following step will be mitigation. As such, a set of steps will be illustrated below to describe the process of bug reports and tests. Upon observing a bug, or having an existing bug be provided to you, you are to follow said steps in a timely manner, without deviating or diverging from the given instructions.

1. Your first and foremost step in the procedure should be to log the bug in the respective bug channel within the MaD Communications server. Make sure to follow proper format, to provide developers with an easier time. 

2. Before it gets logged for developers to address, oftentimes, the QA Coordinator, or any other developer, will group up one or two additional QA Testers. If it is a department issue, then QA Testers of the department concerned in this situation, will be notified.

3. The bug will then be tested, to discover any possible causes, effects, and resolutions. As an example, if SCP-1200-29’s effect damage exists after death caused by SCP-009, one could experiment if this bug is triggered by any damaging anomaly, or any sort of damage in general. While this occurs, make sure to often check the Developer Console `(F9)` for any errors that appear.

4. Upon providing further detail to the bug, to a point where there is enough to thoroughly understand said issue, it will be logged onto the MaD Bug Tracker Spreadsheet, where developers will address it.

5. When developers have attempted and created a resolution to fix the issues provided to them, Quality Assurance will be requested one final time, to ensure that the bug has been resolved, by re-evaluating the bug within the Staging Area. If it has, then instruct the QA Coordinator or any developer to reclassify the issue as “Fixed.” If not, instruct the proper individual to reclassify the bug as “Bug Still Occurs”, then await for another attempted fix.
