As a member of the Manufacturing Department you are given certain special privileges as a reward for work you do.

:::caution
These priveleges are **not a right** - any and all of them can be taken away, for any member at any time. Whilst you will always be able to do what is necessary for your job, abuse of these priveleges will lead to their suspension or removal.
:::

:::note
None of these priveleges may be used on departmental teams (except **Administrative Department, Manufacturing Department** and **Foundation Personnel**). When you are on any other departmental team, you lose rights to  perks given to MaD.

|Privelege|Description|Minimum Rank|Stipulations / Notes|
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
|Vehicle Regulations|In the interests of saving developers and testers time, MaD are permitted *whilst on team* to exceed the maximum speed limit.

|Entering Omicron|**QA Testers** have FI perks (catwalk & observation). **Senior Developers** and above can enter the CDC itself at will. **Probationary Developers** and above can enter the CDC if given permission by MaD Coordination or above.|**QA Testers** and above|Combatives can order anyone below **Senior Developer** to leave areas in Omicron if there is a valid reason (e.g. rioters, hostage situation)
|Entering Phi|All areas of Phi are open to anyone in MaD, including QA Testers.|**QA Testers** and above|None
|Entering Site Alpha (DMR)|**QA Testers** and **Probationary Developers** may enter Site Alpha as if they were SC3+ (e.g. entering any areas except Control Room and Reactor Hall), and can go inside both of those areas if needed for testing. **Senior Developers** and above can enter the Control Room and Reactor Hall at will.|**QA Testers** and above|E&TS and C9 can order anyone below Senior Developer to leave private areas of Alpha if there is a valid reason (e.g. Reactor unstable, CDs roaming).
|Entering Containment Chambers|This means entering the inner zone of a containment area (in Epsilon only, not Clean Rooms)|**Senior Developers** (or authorized by one)|If there is an SCP on, then recontainment forces can order MaD to leave until the chance of a breach is minimized
|SCP Usage|MaD has a tradition of allowing developers who have worked on particular SCPs to play as them or use them, within reason. They must log this within the AA Discord and act according to the guidelines laid out. Developers should **not** be acting on SCPs they do not understand or know the guidelines to.|**Developer** or above|This can be suspended indefinitely by the AA Director at their discretion. MaD must stop playing as an SCP if an Actor for that SCP gets on (except for 131, 368 or 610 of course)
|**Admin Use** - Teleportation|You should **never** bring a user to you unless they have given you permission, AND it is for a valid MaD function (i.e testing or fixing a glitched user). You may teleport TO someone only if it is for a valid reason, or they are also in MaD|**Senior Developer** and above|Refreshing a user does not count as bringing
|**Admin Use** - Moderation|You may kick users who break rules or glitch *when* no SC4+ is online to deal with them, and only when required. You may also respawn them in these cases. You may **ban** users only when they pose a risk to the site (e.g. glitching into CZs to breach, exploiting, glitching out an SCP to become invincible etc). You **must** provide valid evidence in all these cases.|**Senior Developer** and above|Any other instances should be reported to an SC4+
|**Admin Use** - Tools / Loadout|You may give yourself non-weapon, non-dangerous tools (e.g. medical tools, clipboards, etc) **ONLY** whilst on Foundation Personnel, Administrative Department or Manufacturing Department. You may **never** give yourself weapons, or give any tools to users who are not MaD|**Senior Developer** and above|You may give tools to others IF it is to fix a glitched tool, e.g. gun broken.

|**Admin Use** - Client-Sided Commands|(e.g. uptime, stats, region, etc) that do not affect gameplay, and only report things may be used without restriction|Anyone with permissions to run them|None|

## Developer Console

Any developer who has access to the server side command console may run code as needed, but should be sensible whilst doing this.

- Do **NOT** run code you do not personally understand (or didn't write yourself). This poses a danger to the game.
- Do **NOT** use the command bar to give yourself additional priveleges or bypass the admin guidelines laid out above.
