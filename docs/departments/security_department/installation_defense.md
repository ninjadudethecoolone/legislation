## Site Omicron

---

**Site Omicron** is where most of the resources of Security personnel are devoted to. Members of the Security Department are expected to understand Site Omicron at all times, and be present to defend it at all costs. Site Omicron is the location in which Class D personnel reside. Commonly, riots and other combat-orientated events take place within Site Omicron.

All green dots can be maintained by any members of the Security Department at any time. Positions located at the Main Guard Line should always be prioritized over other positions. Members of the Combat Medics are not permitted to enter the main guard line unless they are providing medical support to security personnel who are injured or downed.

Security personnel guarding the Main Guard Line should only be focused on Class D who walk in front of them. For example, the person guard at Guard 4 should not engage at Class D who come in front of Guard 2. Security on the catwalks may engage only when they have obtained a clear shot on a target.

If the glass is broken in the observation windows, you are required to call in a member of the Engineering & Technical Services department.

If you found yourself still confused by said positions. This link will provide you a much more physical interpretation plus more positions not just in the inner CDC itself.

### Solitary Usage

Solitary Usage
Security personnel ranking Junior and above are given Zipties in order to detain rioting Class D. Rioting Class D who have met the following criterion are to be given a strike.

| Offence                                                                                                                                     | Punishment               |

| Any form of civil department duties, involving requesting Class-Ds, has been interrupted two or more times, whether or not it’s the same CD | **Instant Solitary**     |

### Strikes

A Class-D may accumulate up to a total of three strikes before they are designated for solitary confinement (“DFSC”). After their time in solitary confinement is over, their strikes reset.

If they commit an infraction that is an automatic DFSC, all other strikes are voided.

:::note

**Format for strikes:** “/e [CLASS-D] - #(number of strikes)”

**Format for logging SC on radio:** “/e [CLASS-D] SC’ed until XX:XX”

:::

### Solitary Confinement Evasion

If a Class-D is put into solitary confinement and then leaves, that is not classed as evasion. If they rejoin before their time in solitary confinement is over, they will be put back into solitary confinement upon rejoining the game. If this predicament does come upon you, you are allowed to report them with valid proof to an SC-4 and above.

### Riot Foam Usage

The riot foam is another added form of defense within the inner parts of omicron, specifically the inner parts of CDC. Used by security personnel to easily subdue and weaken any possible Class-D rioters that are caught in the foam.

The following is a set of restrictions placed to ensure the usage of this feature is monitored and not abused by any member of the security department.

:::info

**Personnel allowed to initiate the riot foam:**

- **SD** > _Security Guard_ and above
- **SRU** > _Response Operative_ and above
- **MP** > _Constable_ and above
- **CM** > _Specialized Field Medic_ and above

**Riot Foam Criteria:** _(any of)_

- **5+** Class-D’s actively rioting
- **Multiple Class-D’s** have been reported _attempting escape_
- **Uproar, and** current security personnel are unable to take back the _inner CDC_
- Ordered by any **MTF Field Agent+** or **Security Inspector+**

:::

### Uproar

Uproars are considered Class D riots. Uproar may be called once Class D personnel have escaped Site Omicron in large mass. Once five rioting Class D manage to escape Site Omicron, an Uproar may be called.

Once an Uproar is called, the **Security Response Unit** role must be pinged in the Security Department Discord with a brief description of the situation, or the Security Response Unit must be requested via the in-game terminal system. In order to page for SRU on the terminals, you must type the following syntax into the command line; Do not ping them if they’re already online dealing with the situation.

> `request sru Uproar`

**All Sub-Divisional personnel** (MP/CM included) are allowed to push towards Omicron in an attempt to retake CDC. However, it is preferred to push in groups and await assistance from any Security Response Unit operatives.

:::warning

Base SD are not allowed to pass the riot lines, or the reception area during protocol uproar, unless authorized by MP Constable, CM SpFM, SRU Operative+.

:::

During Uproar, security personnel should provide support to any Security Response Unit and Combat Medics to clear Omicron in vital areas, securing its monorail stations as well as ensuring Phi’s safety during the entirety of the protocol.

Uproar must be called off once all escaped Class D and rioters inside Site Omicron have been terminated. A lockdown must be called after Uproars that have lasted at least 10 minutes and only after they have ended, not during.

### Bio Chemistry Assistance

In collaboration between SD and ScD (Specifically the biochemistry sub-division)
ScD have lent their support by giving access to authorized security personnel to request their assistance via giving chemical compounds that aim to improve the physical attributes of security personnel. From movement speed, jump height, and etc.

Only the following personnel are allowed to request for Chemists assistance:

- **SD** > _Security Guard_ and above
- **SRU** > _Response Operative_ and above
- **MP** > _Constable_ and above
- **CM** > _Field Medic_ and above

Following are a set of regulations and restrictions when it comes to requesting the Biochemistry sub-division:

- The Highest ranking SD personnel has priority over the Bio Chemistry Assistance.
- Only request if there is an active uproar. _(5-10 minutes have passed)_
- Authorized by an **Officer+**
- Juggernauts are **NOT ALLOWED** to consume any of the compounds.
- Only **once every uproar** situation per security personnel.
- Only **one effect** is to be administered for every security personnel

### Lockdown

The Omicron lockdown closes all cell doors and prohibits Class D from exiting their cells. To enable a lockdown, there must be at least 1 Security member in each tower’s control room.

Lockdowns may only be initiated under the following conditions:

- Requested by **MTF Agent+** with valid reasoning.
- Rioting that seems to have no stop, even after **7-10+ attempts to stop** said riot.
- Breached SCP has **entered Site Omicron** and containment units aren’t luring it.
- Uproar lasting for **20 minutes** or more

Class D personnel are not permitted to exit their cells during a lockdown. Noncompliant Class D must be given two warnings before termination. During lockdown, security should maintain their positions within the Main Guard Line formations, however, security personnel should patrol around the cell block area. Only **two security personnel** should be patrolling the cells during a lockdown, any other security should focus on the Main Guard Line. SD may go straight to termination, if it’s Red Heron and the SCP is within Omicron.

Lockdown may only be initiated by the following personnel:

- **SD** > _Security Officer_ and above
- **SRU** > _Response Operative_ and above
- **MP** > _Special Constable_ and above
- **CM** > _Senior Field Medic_ and above

During a lockdown, Security Response Unit members should patrol the installation in order to seek out escaped Class D around the Installation.

During a lockdown, at least one member of the Security Department is to be posted in the towers at Omicron at all times. If the guard towers in the cell block are empty, an alarm will sound for 20 seconds before the lockdown is lifted. Security personnel must be posted within the cell block during a lockdown.

Lockdowns may last no longer than 15 minutes unless overridden by an O5 councilor.

### Class D Juggernaut

The Class D Juggernaut is a powerful enemy with an extensive amount of HP and a powerful LMG at their disposal. Class D Juggernauts are a developer product and will appear once someone buys it. There is no limit on how many Class D Juggernauts there can be at one time, however there is a 10 minute cooldown between purchases from the same individual.

The following is a small list of information that is considered vital for any SD personnel should they encounter a Class D Juggernaut:

- Class D Juggernauts are kill-on-sight unless holding a hostage.
- Should you encounter a CD juggernaut, SRU should **immediately** be called to deploy as they have the proper means to counteract such a threat.
- The CD Juggernaut is capable of mowing down heaps of unprepared security personnel with ease. Work together, and bring down the juggernaut with a team.
- Under **no circumstances** should a Class D juggernaut be detained.
- Class D juggernauts are **not to be locked in rooms or terminated via glitches**. Do keep in mind that someone spent 850 robux to play as it.

## Site Epsilon

---

Site Epsilon is an area where _Moderate Containment Zone, Biological Containment Zone and Heavy Containment Zone_ are located. **Mobile Task Force** operatives and **Military Police Constables** are often stationed here to perform their duties. Epsilon holds anything from in-animate objects to Keter class SCPs.

:::warning

Base Security Department operatives are **NOT allowed** within Site Epsilon without the authorization of a **Mobile Task Force Agent+** or a **Military Police Junior Constable+**.

:::

## Site Phi

---

Site Phi is the primary personnel facility. Most civil departments are located within this site. Typically, Security Cadets should be stationed at this Site and should primarily focus on guarding the monorail entrance and the Site’s main entry door or exterior staircase. Site Phi holds a lot of civils rooms such as AD spawn, Foundation Personnel spawn, CWO spawn, MD spawn and Breach Shelter.

At least 1 Security Cadet should be guarding Site Phi at any given time. If there are more than 1 Security Cadet stationed at Site Phi, other cadets may head to Site Omicron.

There is another extension of Site Phi located across the road from the MP checkpoint. This extension holds the Research Wing along with E&Ts Wing. Within the research wing you may locate the Clean Room and within the E&Ts Wing you may locate the generators and E&Ts spawn.

The Breach Shelter is only to be used during **Purple Reign, Red Heron and Oxygen Depletion.** For the breach shelter to be used during Red Heron, the said breached SCP must be found heading or already located within Site Phi. During Purple Reign, non-combatant personnel should be immediately escorted within the Breach Shelter. Whilst Oxygen Depletion is activated, all personnel should escort themselves within the Breach Shelter.

## Installation Command

---

Installation Command is commonly used during trainings for combat scenarios. Security personnel should only enter Installation Command if they suspect Class D personnel are hiding inside.

Only **Security Junior** and above are allowed to enter Installation Command to chase down Class Ds.

## Clean Rooms

---

Within the cleanrooms, various item class SCPs are stored. Primarily, the **Military Police** is responsible for the cleanrooms alongside the **Mobile Task Forces Crimson 9**.

:::caution

Standard security personnel are not permitted to enter the cleanrooms unless they are escorting for testing or training purposes. Security personnel are expected to understand the cleanrooms and each SCP inside and should be taught this information in standard trainings.

:::

## Site Alpha (Dark Matter Reactor)

---

Within the premises of Site Alpha lies the Dark Matter Reactor. Responsible for giving life to the entirety of Area-02. Powering all vital areas of the Installation. Maintained by members of the Engineering & Technical Services and utmost security ensured by **Crimson-9 Agents**. Site Alpha is the heart and soul of the installation.

:::caution

As such, standard security personnel are **prohibited from entering the territory** that is Site Alpha unless explicit permission is granted.

:::

The **Security Response Unit** & The **Military Police** are granted full authority within Site Alpha should there be an active threat (Hostiles, CD’s, and certain tasked situations) and **Crimson-9 > Rhino-8 > Falcon-2 Agents** are unable to respond to the situation.

The **Security Response Unit** should be the first one to call in should DMR experience an active threat from any hostile forces. The **Military Police** should be the next one in line to call in should SRU be unable to respond.

## Patrolling

---

Security Department personnel are responsible for the upkeep of the installation's security efforts. In order to ensure proper conduct, security personnel are permitted to patrol any areas whilst on-duty excluding the following areas:

- Cleanrooms
- Site Epsilon
- Dark Matter Reactor

Security Cadets are permitted to patrol within **Site Phi**. Security Juniors and above are free to patrol the monorail tunnels. Security personnel patrolling the monorail tunnels are not permitted to enter Site Epsilon’s monorail station nor the Dark Matter Reactor. Members of the **Security Response Unit** and the **Military Police**, alongside **Security Officers** are permitted to take command of any patrols ongoing.
