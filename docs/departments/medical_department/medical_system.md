<strong>MedGun</strong> - This item is to be used to assess injuries to yourself or other personnel. Anything from the MedGun shown in blue means that it can be healed using a Bandage. Limbs shown in yellow means that it can be healed using a Splint. Limbs shown in red (excluding the head and torso) means it can be healed using a Tourniquet. Heads and non-downed torso’s can be healed using bandages. Downed torso’s require a Defibrillator.
